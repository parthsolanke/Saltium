Saltium is a secure file-sharing app that encrypts and protects your files with JWT-based access control. Easily upload, encrypt, and share files via download links. Features include token expiration and link invalidation.

### To Do:
- Deploy backend
- Integrate backend APIs and frontend
- ✅ Use a Unique ID Instead of the Full Token
- Public router (only p2p), p2p + uploads for private router.
- P2P file sharing (no size-limits)
- - Error Checking: Use checksums or hashes to verify file integrity after transfer.
- - Fallback Options: Consider implementing a fallback to a centralized server if P2P fails.
