Saltium is a secure file-sharing app that encrypts and protects your files with JWT-based access control. Easily upload, encrypt, and share files via download links. Features include token expiration and link invalidation.

### To Add:
- S3 support (only for signed in users)
- P2P file share (no size-limits)
- UDP to reduce latency in P2P (maybe)
